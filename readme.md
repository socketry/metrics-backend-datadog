``` ruby
# config/initializers/metrics/backend/datadog.rb

require 'metrics/backend/datadog'

module Metrics
	module Backend
		module Datadog
			# Override the default instance setup:
			def self.new
				instance = ::Datadog::Statsd.new('localhost', 8125, logger: Console.logger)
				
				at_exit do
					self.close
				end
				
				return instance
			end
		end
	end
